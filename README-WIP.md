# ‚ú® So you want to run an audit

This `README.md` contains a set of checklists for our audit collaboration.

Your audit will use two repos: 
- **an _audit_ repo** (this one), which is used for scoping your audit and for providing information to wardens
- **a _findings_ repo**, where issues are submitted (shared with you after the audit) 

Ultimately, when we launch the audit, this repo will be made public and will contain the smart contracts to be reviewed and all the information needed for audit participants. The findings repo will be made public after the audit report is published and your team has mitigated the identified issues.

Some of the checklists in this doc are for **C4 (üê∫)** and some of them are for **you as the audit sponsor (‚≠êÔ∏è)**.

# Repo setup

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Sponsor: Add code to this repo

- [ ] Create a PR to this repo with the below changes:
- [ ] Provide a self-contained repository with working commands that will build (at least) all in-scope contracts, and commands that will run tests producing gas reports for the relevant contracts.
- [ ] Make sure your code is thoroughly commented using the [NatSpec format](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.10/natspec-format.html#natspec-format).
- [ ] Please have final versions of contracts and documentation added/updated in this repo **no less than 48 business hours prior to audit start time.**
- [ ] Be prepared for a üö®code freezeüö® for the duration of the audit ‚Äî important because it establishes a level playing field. We want to ensure everyone's looking at the same code, no matter when they look during the audit. (Note: this includes your own repo, since a PR can leak alpha to our wardens!)


---

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Sponsor: Edit this `README.md` file

- [ ] Modify the contents of this `README.md` file. Describe how your code is supposed to work with links to any relevent documentation and any other criteria/details that the C4 Wardens should keep in mind when reviewing. ([Here's a well-constructed example.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation#readme))
- [ ] Review the Gas award pool amount. This can be adjusted up or down, based on your preference - just flag it for Code4rena staff so we can update the pool totals across all comms channels.
- [ ] Optional / nice to have: pre-record a high-level overview of your protocol (not just specific smart contract functions). This saves wardens a lot of time wading through documentation.
- [ ] [This checklist in Notion](https://code4rena.notion.site/Key-info-for-Code4rena-sponsors-f60764c4c4574bbf8e7a6dbd72cc49b4#0cafa01e6201462e9f78677a39e09746) provides some best practices for Code4rena audits.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Sponsor: Final touches
- [ ] Review and confirm the details in the section titled "Scoping details" and alert Code4rena staff of any changes.
- [ ] Check that images and other files used in this README have been uploaded to the repo as a file and then linked in the README using absolute path (e.g. `https://github.com/code-423n4/yourrepo-url/filepath.png`)
- [ ] Ensure that *all* links and image/file paths in this README use absolute paths, not relative paths
- [ ] Check that all README information is in markdown format (HTML does not render on Code4rena.com)

:warning: **Warning** <br /> 

The current version of the lock_box.sol contact fails when doing a CPI call to the Orca Whirlpool program in the `withdraw()` function.
The issue is described here: [CPI issue](https://github.com/hyperledger/solang/issues/1610).

The `withdraw()` function testing is wrapped into a `try-catch` logic.



# Overview 

This audit is focused on parts of the Autonolas protocol. The protocol can be divided in three main parts: governance, registries, and tokenomics. Here an overview of these parts. 

The **governance** is designed to assume various control points to steer the Autonolas protocol. The veOLAS virtualized claim on OLAS
Governance keys componetns are: a governance module (ADDREF), a Timelock (ADDREF), veOLAS (ADDREF). These components allow the community to propose, vote on, and implement changes. The governance token, veOLAS is the virtualized representation of OLAS locked and used a similar approach to veCRV, where votes are weighted depending on the time OLAS is locked other than the amount of locked OLAS. The maximum voting power for a fixed amount of locked OLAS can be achieved with the longest lock. In mathematical terms, voting power is calculated as amount * time_locked / MAXTIME. An overview of the governance process can be found [here](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/pre-c4a/docs/Governance_process.pdf). While the OLAS token is a tradable utility token that will provide access to the core functionalities of the Autonolas project. The token follows the ERC20 standard and is deployed on the Ethereum mainnet. The token has an inflationary model to account for the economic primitives enabled by Autonolas tokenomics, e.g., bonding mechanism and OLAS top-up to boost developers' incentives (cf. OLAS token section [here](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-tokenomics/blob/pre-c4a/docs/Autonolas_tokenomics_audit.pdf) and the [Autonolas withepaper](https://www.autonolas.network/documents/whitepaper/Whitepaper%20v1.0.pdf)). Exceptionally, some changes to the Autonolas Protocol can be executed by a
community-owned multisig wallet (CM), bypassing the governance process. To align CM actions with the DAO‚Äôs intentand ensure their reversibility, a guard mechanism was introduced (see GuardCM code(ADDREF) and [aip-3](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-aip/blob/aip-3/content/aips/core-enhancing-autonolas-protocol-security.md) for more details) 

The core governance coordination mechanisms are anchored on a single chain. However, due to Autonolas‚Äô multi-chain
focus, Autonolas employs cross-chain governance to enable governance actions between Ethereum (L1) and L2 networks like Polygon and Gnosis Chain at present, and others in the future. For cross-chain governance, Autonolas sends messages from Ethereum-based governance contracts to the target chains, employing mechanisms like the [FxPortal](https://github.com/0xPolygon/fx-portal/tree/v1.0.5) for Polygon ( cf. Add contract link) and [Arbitrary Message Bridge (AMB)](https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/tokenbridge/amb-bridge) for Gnosis Chain (cf. Add contract link) . Further details on Autonolas cross-chain bridging design can be found [here](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/pre-c4a/docs/governace_bridge.pdf). Whenever necessary, supplemented contracts are implemented for L1-L2 token transfers, such us the contracts (ADDLINK) enabling transfers of token deployed on Polygon to Ethereum and vice-versa based on a [Polygon-native FxPortal](https://github.com/fx-portal/contracts). Motivations and design overview of token bridgig between Polygon and Ethereum can be found [here](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/pre-c4a/docs/Bonding_mechanism_with_Polygon_LP_token.pdf) 


**Registries** allow developer of code in form of agents, components, or sevices to register and manage their code on-chain. The code existing off-chain will be uniquely represented on-chain by means of NFTs. The registries part under audit is focussed on registations and management of agents and components (off-chain) code  uniquely representeded on chain as NFTs. A summary of registries is provided [here](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-registries/blob/pre-c4a/docs/AgentServicesFunctionality.pdf) 

The **tokenomics** aims to growth useful code and useful capital proportionally. 
- Toward of growth useful code, it is incentivizes the (off-chain) creation and the (on-chain) registration of agents and components code making up useful services via the donations system. Specifically, the developers registering their code on-chain can accrue incentives proportional to their code contribution to registered service which received a donation (cf. the section [How the staking model for agents and component code is incentivized](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-tokenomics/blob/pre-c4a/docs/Autonolas_tokenomics_audit.pdf)). 
- In order to grow useful capital, the protocol can grow its own liquidity by incentivizing
liquidity providers to sell their own liquidity pairs (with one of the tokens in the pair
being the protocol token, e.g. OLAS-ETH) to the protocol for OLAS at a discount (cf. the section [How and when the bonding mechanism is incentivized](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-tokenomics/blob/pre-c4a/docs/Autonolas_tokenomics_audit.pdf)).)
Cf. the [Autonolas tokenomics paper](https://www.autonolas.network/documents/whitepaper/Autonolas_Tokenomics_Core_Technical_Document.pdf) for more details. 

For enabling bonding of pairs on different chains the following workflow is used:

- Move OLAS token from Ethereum to the target chain, using bridges with low trust requirements, good security, and minimal manual and team interaction to start the process.
- Create an LP-token on the target chain with the bridged OLAS token on the target chain and use popular decentralized exchanges with a Uni-v2-style AMM design.
- Transfer the LP-token back to Ethereum using the same bridge methods.
- Use the transferred LP-token for bonding in Autonolas' mechanism on Ethereum.

Whenever necessary additional contracts are deployed to enable seamless bonding participation. This is the case for enabling bonding on Solana. Specifically, [Orca](https://docs.orca.so/) AMM to create the LP-token can be used on Solana. Despite the possibility of creating full [range deposit](https://docs.orca.so/reference/full-range-deposit-pools) with Orca, LPs retain the ability to provide concentrated liquidity within a specific range, and as representations of their liquidity they receive non-fungible tokens. To ensure compatibility with the existing [depository model]() (ADDLINL) the contract (ADDLINK) is designed to encapsulate concentrated liquidity from Orca whirlpool contract and represent the liquidity with a full range with fungible tokens. More details and an overview of the design can be found [here](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-tokenomics-solana/blob/main/docs/Bonding%20mechanism%20with%20liquidity%20on%20Solana..pdf).

# External imports

- @prb/math/src/Common.sol 

# Additional Context

- [ ] Describe any novel or unique curve logic or mathematical models implemented in the contracts
- [ ] Please list specific ERC20 that your protocol is anticipated to interact with. Could be "any" (literally anything, fee on transfer tokens, ERC777 tokens and so forth) or a list of tokens you envision using on launch.
- [ ] Please list specific ERC721 that your protocol is anticipated to interact with.
- [ ] Which blockchains will this code be deployed to, and are considered in scope for this audit?
- [ ] Please list all trusted roles (e.g. operators, slashers, pausers, etc.), the privileges they hold, and any conditions under which privilege escalation is expected/allowable
- [ ] In the event of a DOS, could you outline a minimum duration after which you would consider a finding to be valid? This question is asked in the context of most systems' capacity to handle DoS attacks gracefully for a certain period.
- [ ] Is any part of your implementation intended to conform to any EIP's? If yes, please list the contracts in this format: 
  - `Contract1`: Should comply with `ERC/EIPX`
  - `Contract2`: Should comply with `ERC/EIPY`

## Attack ideas (Where to look for bugs)
*List specific areas to address - see [this blog post](https://medium.com/code4rena/the-security-council-elections-within-the-arbitrum-dao-a-comprehensive-guide-aa6d001aae60#9adb) for an example*

## Main invariants
*Describe the project's main invariants (properties that should NEVER EVER be broken).*

:warning: **Warning** <br />
The current version of the code fails when doing a CPI call to the Orca Whirlpool program in the `withdraw()` function.
The issue is described here: [CPI issue](https://github.com/hyperledger/solang/issues/1610).
For the moment, the `withdraw()` function testing is wrapped into a `try-catch` logic.
