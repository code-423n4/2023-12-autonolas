# Internal audit of autonolas-tokenomics
The review has been performed based on the contract code in the following repository:<br>
`https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-tokenomics` <br>
commit: `383a4310270d801197bb45df408d19d16dbbfb54` or `v0.1.0.pre-internal-audit`<br> 

## Objectives
The audit focused on contracts in this repo.

### Flatten version
Flatten version of contracts. [contracts](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-tokenomics/blob/main/audits/internal/analysis/contracts) 

### Storage and proxy
Using sol2uml tools: https://github.com/naddison36/sol2uml <br>

[Tokenomics-storage](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-tokenomics/blob/main/audits/internal/analysis/storage/Tokenomics.png) <br>
[Depository-storage](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-tokenomics/blob/main/audits/internal/analysis/storage/Depository.png) <br>
[Dispenser-storage](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-tokenomics/blob/main/audits/internal/analysis/storage/Dispenser.png) <br>
[Treasury-storage](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-tokenomics/blob/main/audits/internal/analysis/storage/Treasury.png) <br>
[DonatorBlacklist-storage](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-tokenomics/blob/main/audits/internal/analysis/storage/DonatorBlacklist.png) <br>
[TokenomicsProxy-storage](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-tokenomics/blob/main/audits/internal/analysis/storage/TokenomicsProxy.png) <br>

From the point of view of auditing a proxy contract, only 2 storage are important: Tokenomics and TokenomicsProxy. <br>
[Tokenomics-storage](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-tokenomics/blob/main/audits/internal/analysis/storage/Tokenomics.png) - 18 slots <br>
[TokenomicsProxy-storage](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-tokenomics/blob/main/audits/internal/analysis/storage/TokenomicsProxy.png) - 0 slots <br>
When there will be future implementations, it is critical that the storage be used: current as is + new variables. <br>
One of the semi-automatic verification algorithms:
```
1. enable hardhat.config.js:
// storage layout tool
require('hardhat-storage-layout');
2. enable test Tokenomics.js
let storageLayout = true;
3. run npx hardhat test
4. Compare the number and content of slots for the current implementation and the future one.
```
The remaining storage layouts are useful for final optimization. <br>

Proxy Conclusions: <br>
- Implementation conforms on Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard (UUPS) EIP-1822 standard
- Implementation address located in a unique storage slot in the proxy contract.
- Upgrade logic located in the implementation contract.
- Contract verification is possible, most evm block explorers support it. <br>
Well known vulnerabilities: <br>
- Uninitialized proxy: no ‚úîÔ∏è
- Function clashing: no ‚úîÔ∏è
- Selfdestruct: no ‚úîÔ∏è <br>
Tokenomics.sol as implementation should not contain delegatecall itself. <br>
Example of issue: https://github.com/YAcademy-Residents/Solidity-Proxy-Playground/tree/main/src/function_clashing/UUPS_functionClashing <br>

#### Updated contract storage
[Tokenomics-storage](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-tokenomics/blob/main/audits/internal/analysis/storage/updated/Tokenomics.png) <br>
[Depository-storage](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-tokenomics/blob/main/audits/internal/analysis/storage/updated/Depository.png) <br>
[Dispenser-storage](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-tokenomics/blob/main/audits/internal/analysis/storage/updated/Dispenser.png) <br>
[Treasury-storage](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-tokenomics/blob/main/audits/internal/analysis/storage/updated/Treasury.png) <br>

All the contracts got reduced by a minimum of 2 slots, which results in contract size deployment as well.

### Fuzzing. Updated 15-12-22
#### In-place testing with Scribble
```
./scripts/scribble.sh Treasury.sol
./scripts/scribble.sh TokenomicsProxy.sol -- skipped, not suitable for testing with this tool
- I did not find a native way checking slot by index like sload(PROXY_TOKENOMICS)
./scripts/scribble.sh TokenomicsConstants.sol -- skipped, not suitable for testing with this tool
Scibble bugs, problem:
- Incorrect postprocessing pure/view function to public in instrumental version. As a result, it breaks a properly working test
- I did not find a native way to evaluate an expression like 1e27 * (1.02)^(x-9). This renders the check useless.
./scripts/scribble.sh Depository.sol
./scripts/scribble.sh Tokenomics.sol
```
All found issues are located in "Security issues"

### Security issues.
#### Problems found instrumentally
Several checks are obtained automatically. They are commented. Some issues found need to be fixed. <br>
All automatic warnings are listed in the following file, concerns of which we address in more detail below: <br>
[slither-full](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-tokenomics/blob/main/audits/internal/analysis/slither_full.txt) <br>
Short list: <br>
- ignores return value by IERC20(olas). Recommendation: needs to be fixed.
- performs a multiplication on the result of a division. Recommendation: must to be fixed.
- should emit an event. Recommendation: must to be fixed.
- lacks a zero-check. Recommendation: needs to be fixed.
- add a reentrancy guard for any blacklisted contract. Recommendation: must to be fixed (if planned external blacklist contract) 
- re-check gas optimization for delete mapUserBonds[bondIds[i]]. Recommendation: pay attention. 
- too similar variable. Recommendation: are welcome but no required to be fixed. Minor issue.

#### Problems found by manual analysis or semi-automatically
##### Treasury function depositServiceDonationsETH. 
```
Detected problem and needs an explanation.
As a result, there will be at least a desynchronization between the amount of eth on Treasury (this.balance) and 2 variables: ETHFromServices and ETHOwned.
if donationETH < msg.value then delta = msg.value - donationETH becomes irrelevant to anyone.
    ///if_succeeds {:msg "updated ETHFromServices"} ETHFromServices == old(ETHFromServices) + msg.value; !!! fails
    function depositServiceDonationsETH(uint256[] memory serviceIds, uint256[] memory amounts) external payable {
    ...
    // Accumulate received donation from services
    uint256 donationETH = ITokenomics(tokenomics).trackServiceDonations(msg.sender, serviceIds, amounts);
    donationETH += ETHFromServices;
    ETHFromServices = uint96(donationETH); !!! donationETH != msg.value
or with console.log
    console.log("ETH sended",msg.value);
    console.log("ETHFromServices before",ETHFromServices);
    // Accumulate received donation from services
    uint256 donationETH = ITokenomics(tokenomics).trackServiceDonations(msg.sender, serviceIds, amounts);
    int256 delta = int256(msg.value - donationETH);
    console.log("delta");
    console.logInt(delta); 
    console.log("donationETH calc",donationETH);
    donationETH += ETHFromServices;
    ETHFromServices = uint96(donationETH);
    console.log("ETHFromServices after",ETHFromServices);
    emit DepositETHFromServices(msg.sender, donationETH);

Deposits ETH from protocol-owned services
      ‚úì Should fail when depositing a zero value
      ‚úì Should fail when input arrays do not match
      ‚úì Should fail when the amount does not match the total donation amounts
      ‚úì Should fail when there is at least one zero donation amount passed
ETH sended 10000000000000000000000000
ETHFromServices before 0
delta
9999999000000000000000000
donationETH calc 1000000000000000000
ETHFromServices after 1000000000000000000
Even if in this case, this is due to "Mock"-tokenomics - but the logic as a whole needs to be corrected.
Please pay attention:
Ref: trackServiceDonations
donationETH = mapEpochTokenomics[curEpoch].epochPoint.totalDonationsETH + donationETH; ! so returned donationETH = x + msg.value;
```
Recommendation: must to be fixed. certain bug. üí•

##### Fixes
- [1c4ac57a7f5aa1cd017101f5bcb8d3c4e342b680](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-tokenomics/commit/1c4ac57a7f5aa1cd017101f5bcb8d3c4e342b680).

#### Depository function getPendingBonds. 
```
function getPendingBonds(address account) external view returns (uint256[] memory bondIds, uint256 payout) {
    uint256 numAccountBonds;
    // Calculate the number of pending bonds
    uint256 numBonds = bondCounter;
    bool[] memory positions = new bool[](numBonds);
    // Record the bond number if it belongs to the account address and was not yet redeemed
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < numBonds; i++) {
        if (mapUserBonds[i].account == account && mapUserBonds[i].payout > 0) {
    + block.timestamp >= mapUserBonds[bondId].maturity
    Otherwise:
    redeem(getPendingBonds()) can be fails on:
    bool matured = (block.timestamp >= mapUserBonds[bondIds[i]].maturity) && (pay > 0);
     // Revert if the bond does not exist or is not matured yet
    if (!matured) {
        revert BondNotRedeemable(bondIds[i]);
    }
Explanation: we rely on the presence of a helper view function for the function redeem(uint256[] memory bondIds), which will form the correct array of bondIds.
But, current getPendingBonds() returns the array of ids that does not satisfy the condition: block.timestamp >= mapUserBonds[bondIds[i]].maturity
Accordingly, the user does not have a function whose result can be safely used as redeem input.
```
Recommendation: must to be fixed. Bug from point view of UX. üî∂

#### Minor issue and necessary logical fixes
##### Unused event
This is not a runtime error, but the contract needs to be cleaned up to reduce the bytecode. <br>
[Unused event](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-tokenomics/blob/main/audits/internal/analysis/unused_event.md) <br>

##### Treasury pause for some other functions.
```
Please pay attention: 
I marked the functions that need to be re-analyzed - whether they should also be paused.
Perhaps not a bug.
```
Recommendation: pay attention. 

##### Fixes
- Has left TODO-s, decision is pending.

##### Tokenomics epochLen can be zero by misconfig
```
    function initializeTokenomics(
        epochLen = _epochLen;
```
Recommendation: needs to be fixed.

##### Tokenomics && Treasury. Parameters must have reasonable lower bounds.
```
epochLen - Must have a minimum reasonable duration. The "physical" limit is 2 * time between blocks, but realistically should be something like a week.
function depositServiceDonationsETH - It is desirable to have the minimum reasonable amount of ETH(wei) and revert if msg.value < LIMIT.
From the point of view of calculations, minimum values are sufficient, for example 1gWei.
From the point of view of protection against "Dusting attack", we can set a reasonable minimum value that will allow anybody to send allowed values, but will limit explicit spam.
The latter also refers to the receive().

### Improvements related to critical external updates
#### Update a external fixed point library and fixed point related code
Not an bug, but it is desirable in own codebase to switch on latest v3.0.0 of original https://github.com/paulrberg/prb-math <br>
Since our business logic does not involve the use of negative numbers (fKD), we need to unsigned 60.18-decimal fixed-point numbers. <br>
https://github.com/paulrberg/prb-math/blob/main/src/UD60x18.sol#L589 - —Åheaper and easier. <br>
https://github.com/paulrberg/prb-math/releases/tag/v3.0.0
```
Rename fromInt to toSD59x18 and toInt to fromSD59x18 (a69b4b) (@paulrberg)
Rename fromUint to toUD60x18 and toUint to fromUD60x18 (a69b4b) (@paulrberg)
```
```
Based on practical application, only the following functions are important to us: from(U)Int(latest:toXXYYx18), mul, div
https://github.com/paulrberg/prb-math/blob/main/test/ud60x18/conversion/to/to.t.sol
https://github.com/paulrberg/prb-math/blob/main/test/ud60x18/mathematical/mul/mul.t.sol
https://github.com/paulrberg/prb-math/blob/main/test/ud60x18/mathematical/div/div.t.sol
prb-math$ forge test
OK
```
I advise to always keep the value of `epsilonRate` low as needed. <br>
Since it has the property of an internal independent barrier.
```
    int256 fp1 = PRBMathSD59x18.fromInt(int256(incentives[1])) / 1e18;
    // Convert (codeUnits * devsPerCapital)
    int256 fp2 = PRBMathSD59x18.fromInt(int256(codeUnits * tp.epochPoint.devsPerCapital));
    // fp1 == codeUnits * devsPerCapital * treasuryRewards
    fp1 = fp1.mul(fp2);
    // fp2 = codeUnits * newOwners
    fp2 = PRBMathSD59x18.fromInt(int256(codeUnits * tp.epochPoint.numNewOwners));
    // fp = codeUnits * devsPerCapital * treasuryRewards + codeUnits * newOwners;
    int256 fp = fp1 + fp2;
    // fp = fp/100 - calculate the final value in fixed point
    fp = fp.div(PRBMathSD59x18.fromInt(100));
    // fKD in the state that is comparable with epsilon rate
    uint256 fKD = uint256(fp);

    // Compare with epsilon rate and choose the smallest one
    if (fKD > epsilonRate) {
        fKD = epsilonRate;
    }
```
Recommendation: must to be fixed. ‚ú¥Ô∏è

### Optimization
#### Depository reedem() && close() vs product.purchased.
```
function redeem(uint256[] memory bondIds) public returns (uint256 payout)
...
delete mapBondProducts[productId];
or
function close(uint256 productId) external
...
delete mapBondProducts[productId];
vs
function deposit(uint256 productId, uint256 tokenAmount)
...
    uint256 purchased = product.purchased + tokenAmount;
    product.purchased = uint224(purchased);
Thus, this information will be erased at the time of closing the product.
It makes the field product.purchased a waste of storage.
function deposit(uint256 productId, uint256 tokenAmount) ->
    ITreasury(treasury).depositTokenForOLAS(msg.sender, tokenAmount, token, payout);
    function depositTokenForOLAS(address account, uint256 tokenAmount, address token, uint256 olasMintAmount) 
        uint256 reserves = tokenInfo.reserves + tokenAmount;
        tokenInfo.reserves = uint224(reserves);
This data is accounted in the right place, i.e. in the Treasury. product.purchased = uint224(purchased) - useless
```
Recommendation: must to be fixed. in terms of useless spending of gas, this is a bug. ‚ú¥Ô∏è

### Improvements to tests and code self-documentation.
#### Improvement test if needed
Expicity test: all funds earmarked for developers and temporarily in the treasury are not movable by the owner of the treasury, and vice versa. <br>
Notes: Fulfilled in fact with scribble. ‚úîÔ∏è
#### Explanations for Tokenomics accountOwnerIncentives 
accountOwnerIncentives Requires additional explanation so uses non-obvious mechanics: <br>
```
mapUnitIncentives[unitTypes[i]][unitIds[i]].lastEpoch = 0;
which affects the following calls
trackServiceDonations
_trackServiceDonations
    if (lastEpoch == 0) {
        mapUnitIncentives[unitType][serviceUnitIds[j]].lastEpoch = uint32(curEpoch);
    } else if (lastEpoch < curEpoch) {
        // Finalize component rewards and top-ups if there were pending ones from the previous epoch
        _finalizeIncentivesForUnitId(lastEpoch, unitType, serviceUnitIds[j]);
        // Change the last epoch number
        mapUnitIncentives[unitType][serviceUnitIds[j]].lastEpoch = uint32(curEpoch);
    }
Since the "relations" between "opposite" processes accountOwnerIncentives and trackServiceDonations quite complex and they both called
_finalizeIncentivesForUnitId more explanation is needed.

```
- Added more documentation.

Recommendation: are welcome but no required to be fixed. Minor issue. 
#### Improved Mock contracts
I remade during audit a original MockRegistry.sol: function `drain() external returns (uint256 amount)` now actually sending a ETH. <br>
Notes: Please fixing tests/Mock for real sending a ETH. <br>
Recommendation: needs to be fixed. Without this, the rules written in the language scribble will not work correctly.
