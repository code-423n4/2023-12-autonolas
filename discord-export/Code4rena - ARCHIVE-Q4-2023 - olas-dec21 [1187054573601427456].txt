[12/22/2023 13:14] thetechnofeak
@david_enim  I find it difficult to grasp the concept of registries in Autonolas? Additionally, what's the significance of assigning NFTs to off-chain codes rather than having them directly on the blockchain? What purpose does this NFT assignment serve?


[12/22/2023 14:38] david_enim
First a point on context:

- the Olas protocol has three parts to it: 1) governance, 2) registries, 3) tokenomics. Both 1 & 3 are fully covered by the contest. 2 is only covered partially (i.e. the whole service level is excluded). This decision was made as the code base is already very large and it makes sense to break it up into potentially more than one contest.

Re your question:

- there are three types of registries: component, agent and service. The third one being excluded from the contest as per point above.
- the NFTs represent off-chain code on-chain and are heavily used in some of the tokenomics, specifically the developer rewards mechanism. You can find all the details (also linked from audit repo) in the tokenomics paper and whitepaper (https://www.autonolas.network/whitepaper). We'll also provide some introductions in the coming days ...
- simple use case example: dev owns a component NFT. If a service referencing this NFT as a dependency gets so called donations then at the end of the epoch the component accrues dev rewards. Donations happen either out of pure goodwill or because the donator has an incentive to incentivise the dev (e.g. the Olas DAO wants to incentivise developers contributing to services owned by the Olas DAO)

can you tell me the version that you guys are using in your contracts ?


[12/23/2023 08:33] kupermind
They are starting from 0.8.15 in governance, however all are compiled with 0.8.23 by default as specified in hardhat config


[12/23/2023 09:51] stryder1496
so the version was set as ^4.9.5 in package-lock.json but i changed it to "        "@openzeppelin/contracts": "4.8.3" but the same error is showing up


[12/23/2023 09:58] kupermind
I am not sure why it's set in the package-lock.json, which is not part of the repo. You have changed the version in it, but it seems like you have not rebuilt. Please remove node_modules folder completely, then run yarn again

Is there any new part of the code, which is the focus of this audit, because I saw that there are some old audits and also Imunify submissions.


[12/24/2023 08:37] pi_disc
Hey @nmirchev8 majority of contracts were already audited and were part of immunefi. The new GuardCM implementation ( in governance/contracts/multisigs ) and the  lockbox-solana solidity contracts were only internally audited and were not part of immunefy yet

what does without mapping means in fx portal:

```
In short, this bridge allows arbitrary message bridging without mapping, with built-in support for a number of token standards.
```


[12/24/2023 10:32] kupermind
Mapping meant deploying a mirror token on Polygon PoS, if one does not exist. In the case of our contracts, there is no mapping, just a message passing bridge delivering token info of already pre-defined tokens on both sides of the bridge


[12/24/2023 18:34] spacecake8961
Hello 👋 Beginner here and looking to get feedback or help on my approach if possible.
I have cloned the repository, successfully ran tests for Governance, Tokenomics and Registries.
Next I am thinking to do the following:
1. Deploy the smart contracts locally: I have Ganache installed and ready but was not able to deploy Governance smart contracts on it yet. I tried the command `npx hardhat deploy` after pointing the Hardhat configuration to my local Ganache RPC server. Additionally, I found this separate Governance repository with deployment scripts (https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance) but  I am not too sure if I should use them or if it is getting out of scope
2. Interact with the deployed smart contracts following usage scenarios, which I am going to be researching after.

I would love any type of feedback to this methodology. Keep in mind I am new to Web3 auditing, and a Web2 developer 🙂


[12/24/2023 19:20] kupermind
Hello, please refer to README-s in each of the subrepos, specifically to the deployment section, like this one here:

In original repositories we have mentions about deployment of all the smart contracts. Also, they have scripts for each and every smart contract deployment. FYI I would like to mention here again those are not parts of the c4a audit, but can serve as a supplement material for these specific needs.


[12/24/2023 19:23] kupermind
There is also a README in each of the `scripts/deployment` folder, like the one here, with the detailed instruction of how the scripts are configured and run:

[12/27/2023 16:32] kupermind
Try to use a specific version of the forge build, as the one from the CI:
https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-tokenomics/blob/1cb1a0cbef4d04d940094cd00082b1da052d3814/.github/workflows/workflow.yaml#L27-L30


[12/28/2023 00:47] .bugzyvonbuggernaut
Didn't work. I can run `forge test --hh -vv` on the `autonolas-tokenomics` repo, but not within tokenomics of the code4rena / competition repository.


[12/28/2023 00:48] .bugzyvonbuggernaut
The problem has to do with Foundry's Git integrations and because "/tokenomics" is nested / not at root level


[12/28/2023 00:48] .bugzyvonbuggernaut
The quick fix is to run `git init` inside `tokenomics` and then the Foundry tests will run.

Do people acquire Olas token when they provide liquidity like uniswap?


[12/29/2023 07:22] kupermind
There are bonding products where people provide their LP tokens for OLAS after some vesting period defined by the product


[12/29/2023 07:27] guy_in0xnito
So is it like 
User deposit liquidity in protocol -> get LP tokens -> deposit LP tokens -> get OLAS(utility token)

And if users want to participate in governance they can lock this OLAS. Token for max of 4 years for creating proposal

As a community you mean 
People who are initially locking up  OLAS token


[12/29/2023 12:30] nmirchev8
So actions, which are planned to be available for community multisig must be initiated trough GuardCM?

If we have transaction X to be executed to the Gov and CM initialise it:
Multisig wallet initiate transaction => GuardCM check the params => intended transaction execution?

@kupermind what is wrong?


[12/29/2023 14:02] kupermind
sol files are there because it's written on Solang!

@Sweet Dream this is an ubuntu env as well, check if you need to install solang, although it's supposedly included in the anchor 0.29.0, so I can't help more than that

[12/29/2023 14:42] kupermind
@everybody: I believe it is clear and was confirmed by many of you that all the packages compile and run tests correctly (except for the forge issue that was described earlier and thanks again for the heads up). Thus, all the compilation questions will be ignored to cut audit-unrelated questions and save up on time spent on that.

Please read README-s across all the subfolders and the major one, it's all in there.

@kupermind can you please clarify this


[12/29/2023 15:59] kupermind
These are just some DAO members


[12/29/2023 16:12] guy_in0xnito
People who hold veolas ?


[12/29/2023 16:21] kupermind
There's no such requirement, or any other about token holdings. This is a standard multisig with whatever accounts held by DAO members.


[12/29/2023 17:02] guy_in0xnito
Are the dao members or an particular address which has administrative accesss decided by protocol?


[12/29/2023 17:28] kupermind
No, only the CM has a direct PROPOSER role for the Timelock, that's why the GuardCM was implemented to control it


[12/29/2023 23:04] guy_in0xnito
Ig i have to go through the codebase then would get some context


[12/30/2023 05:46] zhaojie
Will the donor receive some kind of token, or just participate in the donation?


[12/30/2023 05:49] zhaojie
Is the main source of funding in the protocol donation or LP Token?


[12/30/2023 05:57] kupermind
Just participate in donation


[12/30/2023 05:58] kupermind
Protocol does not hold any of the donations, they are all split between devs. LPs on another hand are owned by the Treasury.


[12/30/2023 06:00] zhaojie
okay ,I see thanks


[12/30/2023 13:45] guy_in0xnito
What is the difference between agent and component?
Is component a part of agent?


[12/30/2023 13:59] kupermind
Correct, agent has to have at least one component


[12/30/2023 14:00] guy_in0xnito
So where do they actually differ 
Since both of them actually represent Nft ?


[12/30/2023 14:33] kupermind
Configurations / setup. For the scope of the audit and to save on your time I suggest to consider two things:
1. Each of the components / agents have a unique ID and their own NFT contracts;
2. It is irrelevant for the on-chain routines what's in the NFT metadata.

The internals of components / agents is such a broad subject that it would take up all the remaining time to understand that.


[12/30/2023 14:35] kupermind
Components are a code primitive based on just pure code or including other components. Agents include code and are based on at least one component. Services are based on complete agents and define their interactions via the configuration wrapped into the configuration hash.


[12/30/2023 14:41] guy_in0xnito
Thanks got it


[12/30/2023 16:12] 0xnirlin

It's a limiting possible deviation from the default discount factor value. Set as 10% initially.

Where exactly does GuardCM fit in the architecture? `checkTransaction` doesn't submit the transaction so if the CM has a direct PROPOSER role for the Timelock why can't they just schedule any tx?


[01/02/2024 04:18] 0x_white_devil
Hi Guys, Could anyone pls explain `_checkpoint()` why and how it used in `veOLAS.sol` Realy don't know about those maths. Any resoures to learn those.


[01/02/2024 05:14] kupermind
CM is a standard Safe multisig version 1.3.0, thus each of its `execTransaction()` calls is subject to the guard check:

Hi,
Is the address of the manager variable will be different of the address of owner variable in the *Registry contracts?


[01/02/2024 10:12] kupermind
Hi, yes, we use the core-periphery model, and so the interaction with the end user is done via the registries manager contract

What is the control flow across Timelock, GuardCM and CM ??


[01/07/2024 12:34] kupermind
CM is able to schedule calls in the Timelock, and those are guarded by the GuardCM contract


[01/07/2024 12:34] 7a4raf
What happens to the olas funds locked inside the veOLAS contract after the lock period is over? and would the system be affected if a user does not withdraw his funds?


[01/07/2024 12:36] kupermind
Nothing, they remain in veOLAS until the user withdraws them. Their voting power is zero at that point of time. The system is not affected as that voting power is not accounted for anymore.


[01/07/2024 12:37] 7a4raf
even if they remain until another voting period?


[01/07/2024 12:38] 7a4raf
I mean would they automatically have a voting power if another vote is running and they are in the contract?


[01/07/2024 12:38] kupermind
If the lock is expired, then no, they have zero voting power


[01/07/2024 12:38] 7a4raf
all clear, thanks

[01/07/2024 13:32] moray5554
points (checkpoints) are some kinda of stages which depends of tokens lock-time increasing ur voting power?


[01/07/2024 14:11] para8956
Isn't it a bit  confusing to name getCurrentPriceLP a method that return the amount of only one of the token of the pair per LP token ? Because then I don't understand how bonding price is calculated. If you deposit 400 OLAS and 1 ETH to get one LP token and the bonding product price this LP Token at 400 OLAS what's the point of the discount if it is based on half the value of the LP token ?


[01/07/2024 14:12] kupermind
They serve as a means of interpolating voting power

{Reactions}
❤️ 

[01/07/2024 14:13] kupermind
This function is not used in order to set priceLP. You have a point on that one as the function returns only the OLAS part of LP calculation based on current reserves and a total supply. In a priceLP calculation we always multiply by 2.


[01/07/2024 14:14] para8956
Ok thanks for the reply. Got confused because in the test the value is taken as is to create products!
